# Import from Apple Photos

The Apple Photos app provides an easy way download all your data.

Select the files you want to export (`Command + A` to select them all), and
click on `File` > `Export` > `Export Unmodified Originals`.

In the dialog that pops up, select File Name as `Sequential` and provide any
prefix you'd like. This is to make sure that we combine the photo and video
portions of your Live Photos correctly.

Finally, choose an export directory and confirm by clicking `Export Originals`.
You will receive a notification from the app once your export is complete.

Now simply drag and drop the downloaded folders into
[our desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop) and grab a cup of coffee (or
a good night's sleep, depending on the size of your library) while we handle the
rest.

> Note: In case your uploads get interrupted, just drag and drop the folders
> into the same albums again, and we will ignore already backed up files and
> upload just the rest.

If you run into any issues during this migration, please reach out to
[support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) and we will be happy to help you!
